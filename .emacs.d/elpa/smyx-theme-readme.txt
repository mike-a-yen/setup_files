This theme is based on smyck created by hukl.
(https://github.com/hukl/Smyck-Color-Scheme)
The cyberpunk theme was used as a starting point for smyx which was
created by Nicholas M. Van Horn.

This theme is a port of the overtone/emacs-live theme of the same name
(https://github.com/overtone/emacs-live). The original theme was
designed for use with the color-theme package. This theme adopts the
new built-in theme support deftheme. Additionally, this
theme strives to offer as many mode-specific customizations as
possible, with further tweaks that suit my fancy.
